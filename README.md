PookieScripts Playerlist
A clean and simple playerlist for your FiveM server. Shows who's online, their ID, and their job if they're on duty. Nothing fancy — just works.

🔧 Features
Modern, clean design

Shows player name, server ID, and job

Lightweight and smooth

🧰 Job Display Info
To show players’ jobs (like EMS, Tow, or Police), you’ll need our other PookieScripts:

EMS script
Once those are running, the playerlist will automatically show who’s on duty.

📦 How to Install
Drop the PookieScripts_Playerlist folder in your resources folder.

Add this to your server.cfg:

ruby

Edit
ensure PookieScripts_Playerlist
Restart your server.

▶️ How to Use
Open the list using a keybind or command (depends how you set it).

Customize the UI in the config if you want to change the look or feel.
